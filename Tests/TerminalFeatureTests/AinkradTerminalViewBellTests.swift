///
/// `LocalProcessTerminalView` forwards only four callbacks to its
/// `processDelegate`, and `bell` is not one of them — so this behaviour exists
/// only because `AinkradTerminalView` overrides it. If a SwiftTerm bump ever
/// changes that method's shape, the override silently stops being an override
/// and the terminal goes quiet again. This test fails when that happens.
