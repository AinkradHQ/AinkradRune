/// Publishes Terminal's read side to the host assistant as MCP resources.
///
/// Terminal is the third adopter after Git Mage (35 tools) and Lore (8 tools +
/// 1 resource), and the first that publishes **no tools at all**. That is
/// deliberate, not an unfinished state:
///
/// - **`run_terminal` stays host-owned.** It drives `ExecutionRouter`, the
///   sandbox tiers and live output streaming into the timeline. Re-publishing
///   it here would move a command-execution gate out of the host for reasons
///   that have nothing to do with MCP, and weaken it in the process.
/// - **`terminal.echo` is host→app plumbing**, not agent-facing: the host has
///   already run the command and captured the output, and the action just
///   paints it into the visible buffer. It stays a gated `AgentAction`.
///
/// What is left, and what an app is uniquely able to answer, is the READ side:
/// what is on screen, and where the shell is.

        // restored session. The user's previous scrollback is gone either way.
